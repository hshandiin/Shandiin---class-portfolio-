                                    <h1>The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People</h1>
                                    I am very interested in the data visualization of this class because I have always been a visual learner so I think I for me the best way to remember data is having an actual visual representation. I chose to explore the piece The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People. This piece is very engaging allowing the viewer to uncover the statistics of each person. It is very accessible and easy to understand, combining reams of data into a single page. It also utilizes color to easily distinguish trends while allowing the viewer to get a global sense of the used data. Additionally, it shows a nice comparison between each people without having to dig too deep. I really like the aesthetic of this piece and the colors chosen. It is both information, but pleasing to look at.

                                    <h2>Here is Today</h2>
                                    I really like the concept behind this piece because it is so different from than anything I have seen before. I think it is a really fascinating take on perspective, time, and place. It is also fun to interactive with because the user doesnâ€™t know how long it will keep going or when it will start over. Also, it is cognizant of the day and time the user is viewing this graph so it is sure to incorporate that aspect into the experience. Again, it is simple enough that it is accessible to everyone, which is something I really appreciate.                                     <p>
