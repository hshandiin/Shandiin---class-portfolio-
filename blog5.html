                                    <h1>Prosomiosis</h1>
                                    This piece is called Prosomiosis by Eva Papamargarati and was originally created for the 'Language of Dreams' exhibition, Hoxton Gallery, London. What I found very interesting was the use of color and shape to captivate people’s attention. Also interesting is the use of patterns, geometries, and objects found in a virtual ecosystem. It was cool to see a digital version of what the artist created to be an ecosystem. I also really enjoyed the audio that came along with it. I thought it really aligned well with the moving images and kept viewers engaged.

                                    <h2>Eye Code</h2>
                                    The Eyecode piece is an interactive installation created by Golan Levin in 2007 and displayed in New York at bitforms gallery. I found this work to be extremely peculiar because it is literally constructed from its own history of being viewed! There is a hidden camera and its system records and replays video clips of people who view the display. This results in a, “typographic tapestry of recursive observation”. I personally have not seen anything like this so it was really cool to see a piece of artwork that is literally a reflection of its viewers.
