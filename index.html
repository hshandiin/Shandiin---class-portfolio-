        <h3>Project One</h3>
        <p>This is my first sketch depicting images of my home, Monument Valley, and aspects of my tribal nation. There are four Navajo baskets on each corner of the canvas, and the Navajo Nation seal in the middle. The background changes color with the movements of the mouse which in many ways can resemble a changing environment. Though the environment changes with movement, the aspects of culture and home remain constant. Written at the top of the page I have written "Yá'át'ééh",the Navajo word for "hello". Also written is "Nizhónígo Nee Ado’ááł", which translates to, "have a good day". The protections and preservation of my Indigenouse language, culture, and ancestral lands is important to me and it is what I hoped to depict in my sketch.</p>

        <h3>Project Two</h3>
        <p> This sketch was inspired by all the rain we have been getting in North Caroina this spring. In Navajo culture we recognize two forms of rain, male and female. Male rain is more associated with thunderstorms and torrential rain, often occuring during monsoon seasons. Female rain is more of a gentle, slow-moving rain, accompanied frequently by low clouds and mist. Additionally, Female rains are associated with the stirring of the seasons when spring rains bring the high desert to life - this is especially true in the Southwest where our ancestral lands are located. Like much else in our cultural beliefs there is duality introduced in rain and we recognize this equilibrium between the two forces, qualities, and characteristics to enable healthfulness, harmony, and beauty. I wanted to incorporate and share this knowledge visually in my sketch. </p>

        <h3>Project Three</h3>
        <p>I wanted my Data Visualization project to reflect an historical year for Native American Women. Seeing women who look like me run for public office and win has been transformational. I wanted to share how important this history is not just for Native communities, but for all communities because women have always had a seat at the table in many tribal societies. It is only now that this is beginning to be reflected on the local, state, and fedral levels. I wanted to use this project to highlight what an amazing year it has truly been for Native women. By creating a map, I hope to offer a visual for how many Native women ran for office across the country!#NativeWomen18</p>

          <h3>Project Four</h3>
          <p>I decided that I wanted to expand my original sketch I did on the Navajo interpretation of rain. I had a lot of fun creating that piece and the feedback I received from my classmates was really positive and they even had more questions on the concepts begin my piece. So, I wanted to expand my project by adding more conceptual information on what inspired my creative process. I included a really pretty timelapse of a rainy day in Monument Valley, UT on the Navajo Nation. Additionally, there are tabs viewers can select that will lead them to more information on the Navajo myth I was told as a child in regards to the first rain. I have also added a basic description of the Navajo emergence story and philisophical beliefs as well as the male and female logic we have of rain. </p>
